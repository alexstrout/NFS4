Notes:
------
The official addon / regional cars were edited slightly:
-- All addon cars moved to DATA\CARS (from SAVEDATA\CARS)
	-- Using DATA\CARS allows AI opponents to also use the addon cars in normal gameplay
	-- Fixed bizarre crash with FEDATA on each car if used from DATA\CARS
-- Fixed missing pursuit tags for:
	BMW M Coupe
	BMW M Roadster
	Ford XR8
	HSV SV99
	Nissan Skyline GT-R V.spec
	Pursuit HSV
-- Ferrari 360 Modena unlocked for Hot Pursuit
-- Ford XR8 designated as Class B (normally Class A, but car performs as Class B)
-- Pursuit HSV designated as Class A (normally Class B, but car performs as Class A)
-- Pursuit HSV renamed to Pursuit HSV SV99 (pursuit cars always reference model, and sometimes make; e.g. Pursuit Corvette, Pursuit Porsche 911 Turbo)
-- Fixed Pursuit HSV engine sounds (engine was using Lister Storm sounds instead of HSV SV99 sounds)
-- Fixed Pursuit HSV fog lights (lights were marked as indicator lights instead of fog lights)
-- Fixed Pursuit HSV vidwall (was lacking HSV logo)
-- Fixed missing Ferrari 360 Modena showcase stats vidwall
	-- There is unfortunately only one of these, as opposed to two like all other cars :(

Additionally, the following fixes were made for vanilla cars:
-- Fixed incorrect interior colors for:
	Pursuit BMW M5
	Pursuit Camaro
	Pursuit Corvette
	Pursuit Diablo
	Pursuit La Niña
	Pursuit HSV SV99
	Pursuit Porsche 911 Turbo
-- Fixed incorrect indicator lights for:
	Lamborghini Diablo SV
	Pursuit Diablo SV
-- Fixed BMW M5 reverse lights (lights were incorrectly placed, and now match Pursuit BMW reverse lights)
-- Fixed Pursuit Camaro tail lights (lights did not properly function as tail lights, and were a little misaligned)
-- Fixed Porsche 911 Turbo interior (an annoying white square could be seen on the spoiler when looking backwards)
-- Fixed Bonus Chevrolet Camaro interior (was slightly misaligned, and now matches regular Chevrolet Camaro interior)
-- Fixed missing interior mirror reflections for:
	Bonus Chevrolet Camaro
	Bonus Porsche

All cars are otherwise 100% vanilla as originally intended. No performance, visual, etc. edits of any kind were made.
They are also using stock serial numbers as supplied by EA.

The selectable AI-only "traffic" police were, however, buffed slightly (read: given Pursuit Camaro performance stats) as their default driving models were painfully slow.
They were also given generic non-branded interiors, since they are normally lacking interiors.
They are using serial numbers 45-48, which are typically used for "extra" cars, so they should be compatible with most other car packs.

If playing over network, make sure all players are using the same versions of cars and tracks. (e.g. this car pack)
Otherwise there will be trouble! :P
