Need for Speed: High Stakes - Supercharged Police AI
Tougher police AI, with special "super cops"
By fox

------
Overview:
------
Adjusts the AI acceleration curves for every police vehicle to yield significantly more challenging pursuits.

Additionally, the following cars are treated as "super cops" and possess much tougher pursuit AI:
	Pursuit Camaro
	Pursuit Corvette
	Pursuit Diablo SV
	Pursuit Porche 911 Turbo

Each track uses one of these in its roster of 5 cops when racing AA class or above.
As such, each race has one "super cop" making somebody miserable. :)

------
Installation:
------
Extract to your root NFS:HS directory. Be sure to make backups first!

If combining with Bonus Cars (recommended), install this after installing Bonus Cars.
If you wish to instead use this without Bonus Cars installed, please skip / delete the following folders:
	DATA\CARS\PCAP
	DATA\CARS\PHAT
	DATA\CARS\PHSV
	DATA\CARS\PSED
	DATA\CARS\PSUV

------
Notes:
------
The following "normal cops" use a slightly modified Pursuit Diablo SV acceleration curve:
	Pursuit BMW M5
	Pursuit Caprice
	Pursuit Hatchback
	Pursuit Sedan
	Pursuit Utility Vehicle

The following "super cops" use a vanilla Pursuit La Niña acceleration curve:
	Pursuit Camaro
	Pursuit Corvette
	Pursuit Diablo SV
	Pursuit HSV SV99 (if Bonus Cars installed)
	Pursuit La Nina (unchanged)
	Pursuit Porche 911 Turbo

These modifications do not affect the performance of the car in any way; only how the AI drive them.

If playing over network, do make sure all players are using this pack if you intend to play Hot Pursuit mode with AI present.
Otherwise there will be trouble! :P

Enjoy!
